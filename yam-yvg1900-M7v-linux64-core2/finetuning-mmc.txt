Fine tuning yvg1900 MMC miner

Most of performance optimizations are about tradeoffs… Imagine you have very fast CPU and very fast 
memory reads, while memory writes give you big performance penalty. Then you would like to avoid 
extra memory writes at cost of extra CPU loads by performing some extra comparisons in your code – 
this may lead to better performance, but may not as well, this is all about tradeoffs.

Some tradeoffs can be inferred from detectable hardware configuration – CPU model, available 
instruction set, etc., but most are heavily dependent on particular system specifics – memory speed, OS 
kernel configuration, virtualization, and many other parameters. Even more, some tradeoffs depend 
completely on personal preference – do you plan to dedicate machine completely for mining tasks of 
you plan to use it for something else, like browsing the Internet or listening music in background.

Manually finding out the best setup is non-trivial task; it requires perfect discipline and care. So, I 
decided to introduce built-in selection of algorithm variation that produces the best result in particular 
case and specific usage scenario.

1. Determining AES-NI support and number of threads

Note that AES-NI instruction support is extremely important for MMC mining. If AES-NI is not available but
enabled in mining parameters, miner will crash.

MMC mining is very critical to use of HyperThreading. Default setup (av=1&aesni=on&m=1024) is optimal for many
consumer-grade CPUs. Server CPUs with no HyperThreading or plenty of memory bandwidth may benefit from 
other algorithm variations. Same is for Atom CPUs - algorithm variations other than 1 may be working much 
better.

2. Activating fine tuning functionality

Fine tuning is disabled by default.

To enable fine tuning you shall add "av=0" parameter to MMC mining params when launching miner, for
example, if you use config file:

mining-params = mmc:av=0&aesni=on&m=1024

When fine tuning is enabled, miner will perform tests for each available algorithm variation and 
calculate appropriate scores.

As soon as fine tuning measurement stage progresses, you will see the best score displayed at every 
statistics display step. As soon as measurement stage finishes, miner will automatically select one with 
best score and proceed with selected algorithm variation until terminated. You can see currently 
selected variation as a value of "av" parameter.

Note that fine tuning stage may take long time to complete. 

Also note that finetuning requires stable connection to the pool to complete, so if connection gets
terminated, finetuning procedure will be reset. In this case it may make sense to do tuning manually by
trying different AVs and selecting one with lowest possible ART (Average Round Time).

3. Enforcing miner to use specific algorithm variation

As you may guess, miner operation is suboptimal during fine tune measurement stage. If you already 
know your optimal algorithm variation, you may wish to bypass fine tuning measurement stage and 
force miner to use specific algorithm variation. To do this simply specify desired algorithm variation as a 
value of "av" parameter when launching miner.

Good luck mining,
yvg1900
